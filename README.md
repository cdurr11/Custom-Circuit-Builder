## Custom Circuit Builder Tool
This is a tool that can be used by students to simulate resistor circuits.  A circuit can be drawn by clicking on wires and resistors and dragging and connecting nodes.  After a closed circuit has been created, one can query the voltage across different parts of the circuit.  Querying the voltage across the battery yeilds the voltage of the battery.  Querying across resistors yields appropriate values for both series and parallel circuits.

I started this project to learn about the incredibly powerful React library.  I learned a lot through this project, and since I've stopped working on it I've learned much more.  I did this project before a formal software engineering class and resultantly there are no tests and some pieces may not be elegant or easy to read.  Additionally, there are some newer technologies such as TypeScript that I would like to incorporate into the future.  I hope to iterate on this during spare time in the future and continue to incorporate things that I have learned. Enjoy!
